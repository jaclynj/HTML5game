WORK IN PROGRESS

Teaching myself HTML5 game programming, my first attempt at an HTML5 game with JavaScript. This is an astroids-like arcade shooter.

###TODO:
- [DONE] enemies keep coming after you shoot them
- [DONE] make lose conditions/health (if you get hit a certain amount of times the game resets)
- [DONE] Display score and lives on screen
- [DONE] Display 'GAME OVER' and press space to start
namespace everything
- Refactor so future games are easier
- Refactor enemy spawning
- Display 'READY', 'BEGIN',
- spawn more enemies with time
- faster enemies with time
- pause
- make win conditions (?) big boss?
- better graphics
- add music
- high score board when you lose
- powerups..?
